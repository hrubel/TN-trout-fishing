# Tennessee Trout Fishing

## Best Fishing Spots in TN for Trout
### Hallie Rubel


### Summary:

I want to create an interactive dashboard with a map of Tennessee, consisting of bodies of water and campsites. I would also like to include trout stocking schedules along with other species of fish you might catch while fishing for trout.I want the user to be able to choose based location and restocking date then drill down to details.


### Motivation:

My personal motivation, for choosing this topic, as my capstone, is my family. My father has always loved fishing and my brother-in-law recently took up fly fishing, as a hobby. One day my dad expressed his interest in a map that shows
all the bodies of water and a guideline to follow, like times fishing is allowed, types of fish, size limit, and bait. This spiked my interest to look into creating something like that for them to use when deciding their fly fishing trips here in Tennessee.


### Data Question:

If I wanted to go out fly fishing, for trout, where should I go? How far is the body of water away from me? Will I need to make it a weekend trip? What other fish could I also catch while there? And what are the restrictions of size and count of the species?


### Minimum Viable Product:

I would like to have a dashboard with a map on it of Tennessee. I would like that map to consist of bodies of water and campsites then allow a user to navigate through the dashboard with filters to choose from counties, types of fish, and dates of trout restocking. When a body of water is chosen, I would like a card to pop up with information about hours, regulations, and types of fish in the water.
