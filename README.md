## Summary:
I chose to research and create a guide for trout fishing here in Tennessee. A few members of my family enjoy trips to different locations all across the state, but there are times where they struggle to get all the information they need and I wanted to fix that. The visual aid I’ve come up with has a schedule of trout stocked in the bodies of water all across Tennessee, the layout of water and the amount of trout stocked in them, all the access points to the water for fishing, the regulations for trout and different species of fish you may catch and their regulations just in case you want to keep them. I also included a map for parks in the area, if you decide to turn it into a couple day fishing trip, you have a place to camp. So with that visualization you can pull it up fill in your own criteria and save it to take with you to more rural areas.

## Motivation:
My personal motivation for choosing this topic, as my capstone, is my family. My dad and brother-in-law enjoy going out on fishing trips, specifically for trout. One day, they made a comment about how nice it would be to have a map or visualization to help with different access spots and stocking schedules, because they have struggled on their trips to gather all the information they needed or they don’t have service where they are fishing, to look it all up. This spiked my interest to look into creating something like that for them to use when deciding their fishing trips.

## Data Question:
If I wanted to go out fly fishing, for trout, where should I go? How far is the body of water away from me? Will I need to make it a weekend trip? What other fish could I also catch while there? And what are the restrictions of size and count of the species?
